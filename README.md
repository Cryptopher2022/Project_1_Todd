# Project_1_Todd
This is the repository of my work for Project 1

Block 1: Jaime's code - pulling data from data sources and putting them into CSV files.
Block 2: Todd's code - Taking those CSV's and massaging the dataframes so that they do the following:
  a. Only have the number of data points in the requested time interval
  b. removing all but the closing data, leaving the timestamp and "Closing" prices
  c. plotting that data in a simple line graph
Block 3: Visualizations

Additional modifications to Block 2 and merging the code in Block 1

Here's the current state of the project from what I'm calling "Block 2."  My code pulls the CSV files provided by Jaime "Block 1" and puts it into a usable format to build a simple moving average (SMA).  This was uploaded on May 7, 2022 (after our TA session - Saturday) at 2:43 p.m. central time.  

From this point, I will work toward creating functions that do the heavy lifting so they can be called by one main program.  
I will push up that code block to this repository after that's done.  Second activity will be to merge Jaime's code with my code.
